              <p>
                Every place has something special to offer. From fresh apples
                grown in the hills to honey, spices, vegetables and traditional
                products made by local communities, Nepal is rich in products
                connected to their place of origin.
              </p>
              <p>
                GoogleDoko was created to make these products easier to
                discover. Instead of simply searching for a product, customers
                can discover where it comes from, learn about its origin and
                find trusted sellers.
